Ok, let me introduce myself. This is me in pajama.

Basically I’m curious. That curiosity drove me to study [Physics](http://www.ub.edu/fisica/en/), to do a Master in Computational Physics, a PhD in [Nanoscience](http://www.ub.edu/in2ub/doctorat_nanociencia/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27:home-cat-2&catid=9:english&lang=en&Itemid=102), and now a [Course on Data Science and Big Data](http://www.ub.edu/datascience/). 

A part of this, I share my life with my beloved wife Laura, my precious son Júpiter and my dear dog Sawyer. I really like to play ukulele and drums, take pictures, hack devices and run (*Disclaimer: I recommend to don’t try to do all at the same time, it can be as dangerous as ridiculous*).
