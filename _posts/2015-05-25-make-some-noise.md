*This is the first post, don't be too mean ðŸ˜œ.

In this blog I want to share some of the questions/ideas/projects that came to my mind, and their answers/thoughts/progress. Most of them are nonsense (as I realize short after â€“but not short enough ðŸ˜…), while there are some that I consider interesting to share. I'll write this blog in English, not because I like it, which I do, but as an exercise to improve and a way to reach a broader audience (there are [1.3 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population) of English speakers, let me be optimistic).

I will talk about physics, data science, photography, running, ukuleles, parenting and gadgets. If I need to write code I will mainly use ``python``.
